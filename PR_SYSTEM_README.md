## API Endpoints

### Create Pull Request
```bash
POST /api/v1/pull-requests/playbooks/{playbook_id}/pull-requests
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "title": "Improve introduction section",
  "description": "This PR adds better explanations...",
  "new_blog_text": "# Updated content...",
  "base_version_id": "current_version_id_from_playbook_detail"
}
```

**Note:** The `base_version_id` should be the `current_version_id` field from the playbook detail API response (`/playbooks/{playbook_id}/detailed`).

### List Pull Requests
```bash
GET /api/v1/pull-requests/playbooks/{playbook_id}/pull-requests
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Get Pull Request Details
```bash
GET /api/v1/pull-requests/{pr_id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Get Pull Request Diff
```bash
GET /api/v1/pull-requests/{pr_id}/diff?format=unified
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Merge Pull Request
```bash
POST /api/v1/pull-requests/{pr_id}/merge?merge_message=Optional%20merge%20message
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "MERGED",
  "new_version_id": "f0012413-3e75-4d97-8e15-858dc3cfd62e",
  "version_number": 3,
  "message": "mering PR and updating introduction"
}
```

### Close/Decline Pull Request
```bash
POST /api/v1/pull-requests/{pr_id}/close
POST /api/v1/pull-requests/{pr_id}/decline
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Data Models

### PullRequest Interface
```typescript
interface PullRequest {
  id: string;
  playbook_id: string;
  author_id: string;
  base_version_id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  old_blog_text: string;
  new_blog_text: string;
  unified_diff: string;
  status: 'OPEN' | 'MERGED' | 'CLOSED' | 'DECLINED';
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  merged_at: string | null;
  merged_by: string | null;
  merge_message: string | null;
  new_version_id: string | null;
  author_name: string;
  playbook_title: string;
  base_version_number: number;
  new_version_number: number | null;
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Creating a Pull Request
1. User visits a playbook detail page
2. Clicks "Create PR" button (disabled for playbook owners)
3. Modal opens with current content prefilled and base version ID from API
4. User edits title, description, and content
5. Submits PR creation with correct `base_version_id`
6. Automatically navigates to new PR detail page

### 2. Managing Pull Requests
1. PR list shows on playbook detail page sidebar
2. Click on PR to view details
3. View diff in multiple formats
4. Take actions based on permissions:
   - **Merge**: Creates new version and updates playbook
   - **Decline**: Rejects changes with declined status
   - **Close**: Closes without merging

### 3. Diff Viewing
- **Unified**: Traditional diff format with +/- indicators
- **Side-by-side**: Parallel comparison view
- **HTML**: Rich HTML diff rendering
- Statistics show additions/deletions

## Security & Permissions

### Role-based Access Control
- **Playbook Owners**: Cannot create PRs for their own playbooks
- **Authenticated Users**: Can create PRs for others' playbooks
- **PR Authors**: Can close their own PRs
- **Playbook Owners/Admins**: Can merge, decline, or close any PR

### Authentication
- All PR operations require valid JWT token
- Token extracted from sessionStorage
- Automatic error handling for expired tokens

## Error Handling

### API Error Handling
- Network error detection and user-friendly messages
- Authentication error handling with redirect prompts
- Validation error display in forms
- Toast notifications for success/error states

### UI Error States
- Loading states with spinners
- Error boundaries for component failures
- Graceful degradation for missing data
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Styling & Design

### Design System Integration
- Consistent with existing Enux design system
- Shadcn/ui components throughout
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Dark mode support
- Accessibility considerations

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Open PRs, additions in diff
- **Purple**: Merged PRs
- **Red**: Declined PRs, deletions in diff
- **Gray**: Closed PRs, neutral states

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Comments System**: Add comments to PRs
- **Review System**: Request reviews from specific users
- **Branch Management**: Support for multiple branches
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle merge conflicts
- **Notifications**: Email/real-time notifications
- **PR Templates**: Predefined PR templates
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD integration

### Technical Improvements
